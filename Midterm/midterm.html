        <p>Glossier is a new approach to beauty. It is a $1 billion corporation started by the founder and CEO Emily Weiss. Glossier is a make-up and skincare brand that holds over 100 specially designed products. Emily was ony 28 when she started Glossier, but the last 5 years for her have proven successful. It’s about fun and freedom and being OK with yourself in today’s fast pace and judgmental society. They make intuitive, uncomplicated products designed to enhance everyone’s true beauty. For Weiss, the journey started in 2010, when she launched her blog, Into The Gloss, while working as a fashion assistant at Vogue. Weiss’s blog eventually served as a springboard for Glossier, her unicorn makeup and skincare company.

      <h2>Skin Care</h2>
      <p>Proper skin care is important because our skin is the largest barrier against infection that we have. Keeping our skin healthy and moist helps keep this barrier strong. When the skin gets dry or irritated by harsh soaps, cracks in the skin can occur. Cracks in the skin make a person more prone to infection. <br> <br> Glossier takes skin care very seriously. Like they always say, "skin first, make-up second." Glossier has profected their skin care products for all skin types, making everything extremely easy and gentle to use. At glossier, the ideology is <br> that your skin is the makeup you wear everyday, so taking good care of it is the most crucial step in your daily routine. </p>
